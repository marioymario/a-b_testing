## Notes on framework for bussiness experiments ii

There are lots of different possible experimental designs, but A/B testing is probably the most common in business and the one that you are most likely to encounter. A/B testing is a technique used to identify whether one version of an object of interest (such as a product, marketing campaign, or email text) is better at producing the desired outcome than another version.

The components of an A/B test are as follows:

**Two versions of something whose effects will be compared**. Typically one version is a control version; this version is often already in use and represents what would happen given no intervention. The other version, the test version, has some changes from the control; those changes are often called the treatment. If you're starting from scratch, however, you may have two different test versions to compare to each other.

A **sample** divided into two groups. Each sample should be selected so that it is similar to the population you want to understand. The groups should be similar to one another so that any differences between them can be attributed to seeing version A or version B and not something else. You also want the split between A and B to be as random as possible.
Key

**A hypothesis** that articulates what you expect to happen. For example, your hypothesis might be, "I expect that the HTML email will achieve a higher open and conversion rate than the plain-text email."

**An outcome (or outcomes) of interest** and specific descriptions of what you expect will change as a result of using version A or version B, and how you will measure that change. This means that you have to decide on a key metric, which should capture the effect of your change and reflect the motivations for the test in the first place.

**Other measured variables including information about the two groups that can be used to ensure that they are similar, as well as secondary outcomes that are less important than the primary outcomes of interest but which might also change in response to using version A or version B.**

# key terms

**Ceteris paribus**
Latin for "all other things being held equal"; the assumption that every variable except the treatment variable is held equal between groups

**Bias**
Tendency of a sampling method to overestimate or underestimate the value of an underlying population parameter.

**Control variable**
A variable that the researcher controls (holds constant) during an experiment, so as to avoid biased results

**Simpson's paradox**
Also called the lurking variable problem, the phenomenon when an average over several groups shows one trend, but an average for each individual group shows the opposite trend or no trend
