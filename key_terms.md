## La Relacion entre la prueba de la hypotesis y el nivel de confianza

There is an relationship between the confidence interval estimation of a parameter teta and a test of hypothesis concerning teta.

### Important terms

**Null hypothesis**
Hypothesis that proposes that no statistically significant difference exists between two specified populations

**Alternative hypothesis**
Hypothesis that proposes that a statistically significant difference does exist between specified populations


**p-value**
The probability of observing a sample statistic at least as extreme as the one that you have, assuming that the null hypothesis is true

Numbers between 0 and 1 that quantify how confident we should be that sample A is different that sample B.

A p-value threshold of 0.05 means that every 100 experiments we will get one False positive

**Confidence interval**
A statistical range with a specified probability that a given parameter lies within the range

**t-statistic**
Ratio of the departure from parameter value to hypothesized value due to standard error

**Independent-samples t-test**
A test that compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different

**Variance**
A measure of dispersion equal to the average squared deviation (from the mean) of a set of numbers

**Kurtosis**
Measure of the sharpness of a distribution's peak

**Skewness**
Measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution
